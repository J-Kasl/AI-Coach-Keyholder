"""
infrastructure/startup_lease.py

The restart-safe database lease guaranteeing at most one process
instance performs startup reconciliation at a time
(system_state_machine.md Section 7; LEASE-1). An atomic DB write
(`BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, via infrastructure.database.Database.transaction()),
never an in-memory mutex or a PID file — the same reasoning
implementation_conventions.md Section 10 already gives for every other
restart-safe lock in this system.

Independent from, and never a substitute for, the outbox's own claim
mechanism (infrastructure/outbox.py): this lease protects the
reconciliation *steps* from running twice concurrently; the outbox claim
protects the *ongoing publisher* from delivering the same event twice
(system_state_machine.md Section 8).
