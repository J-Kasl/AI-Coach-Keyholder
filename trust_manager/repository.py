trust_manager/repository.py

Trust Manager Slice 1 — the repository built on
infrastructure.database.Database, the same composition pattern
database/database.py already established (Phase 1.2): this class opens
no sqlite3 connections of its own, and every write goes through
`self._core.transaction()`/`apply_transition()`.

Canonical spec: docs/architecture/trust_manager_technical_design.md.
See trust_manager/README.md for exactly what this slice covers and what
is deferred.
