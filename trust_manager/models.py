"""
trust_manager/models.py

Data structures for Trust Manager Slice 1 — Domain Registry, Domain
State, and the Incident/Confirmation/Severity model. Canonical
definitions: docs/architecture/trust_manager_technical_design.md
Sections 2.1, 2.2, 2.4, 2.8, 2.10, 5.1-5.4.

Deferred to a later slice (see trust_manager/README.md): TrustEvidenceDispute,
TrustRecalculation, OverallTrustReport, the Goal Accountability Assessment
evidence types (GOAL_PROGRESS/GOAL_SETBACK are defined in EvidenceType
below since the enum is canonical as a whole, but nothing in this slice
writes them).

These classes carry no business logic beyond their own shape — the
rubric (assess_severity, cooperation_trust_offset) lives in
trust_manager/severity.py; database access lives in
trust_manager/repository.py. Every dataclass with `created_at` follows
this project's Clock-injection convention (implementation_conventions.md;
infrastructure/clock.py) — no default_factory, no hidden timestamp.
