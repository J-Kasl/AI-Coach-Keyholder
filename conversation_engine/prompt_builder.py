"""
conversation_engine/prompt_builder.py

Assembles a ModelGenerationRequest from a ResponseContextSnapshot,
ResponsePlan, and Working Memory turns (memory_system.models.WorkingMemoryTurn
-- immutable types only; this module never imports InMemoryWorkingMemory
or any other concrete storage implementation). The system message is
produced ENTIRELY by deterministic code -- the user's own content is
never concatenated into it. Role separation (a distinct role="user"
message, always) is a structural guarantee, not a textual convention:
user content cannot physically alter the system message, because it
never occupies the same field.

Role separation guarantees that user content cannot physically alter
the deterministically assembled system message. It does not guarantee
that the model can never be influenced by malicious user content.
Slice 2 does not implement a semantic prompt-injection detector; this
remains true after Slice 3's own Working Memory integration.

Slice D adds a deterministic "AUTHORITATIVE APPLICATION STATE" section,
built from `snapshot.context_fragments` -- current domain facts read
fresh from lock_state/task_runtime for this turn, placed BEFORE Working
Memory in the system message. Template metadata (category, difficulty,
completion_requirements, ...) is serialized as plain, labeled DATA
inside this one block -- it never becomes a new ModelMessage, never
changes any message's role, and never gets concatenated into
_SYSTEM_BOUNDARIES or any other instruction text. A namespace/field this
module does not explicitly know how to render is silently skipped, not
guessed at.
