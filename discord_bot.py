bot/discord_bot.py

The Discord adapter — Phase 3.1's minimal vertical slice. Deliberately
a THIN layer: this file's only responsibilities are

  1. connecting to Discord and filtering to direct messages,
  2. converting a discord.Message into a channel-agnostic
     application.models.IncomingMessage,
  3. calling application.service.ApplicationService.handle_message()
     (the ONLY call this file makes into the rest of the system --
     never a domain module directly, never a `_*_in_transaction` method),
  4. sending the returned OutgoingMessage.text back to the same DM,
  5. raw audit logging of both sides of the exchange (Phase 0's
     conversation_messages table -- an adapter-level concern, since the
     Discord-specific channel/message ids it records are inherently
     about THIS channel, not something the channel-agnostic application
     layer should know about),
  6. catching and logging any exception so a single bad message can
     never crash the bot or leak an internal error to the user.

No command parsing, no domain logic, and no decision-making lives here
-- see application/README.md for the actual boundary and
application/service.py for what "status"/"help" actually do.

Running:
    python -m bot.discord_bot
