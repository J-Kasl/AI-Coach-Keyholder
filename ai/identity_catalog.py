"""
ai/identity_catalog.py

The 15-identity catalog, as static reference data -- for onboarding
display and validation ONLY. Does not implement, and must never grow
into, the communication pipeline `ai_identity_technical_design.md`
describes (phrasing a `Decision`, situational constraints, Behavioral
Learning, ...) -- that document remains a full draft, not approved for
implementation. This module exists specifically because
`docs/architecture/user_onboarding_technical_design.md` (approved)
needs somewhere to read the catalog from, without duplicating it as a
second table.

**Single source of truth:** `docs/architecture/ai_identity_technical_design.md`
Section 3 (names, groups, archetypes, localization) and Section 10 (the
six `CommunicationProfile` values per identity). This module is a
direct, literal transcription of those two tables -- if they ever
diverge, the design document is the one to trust, and this module has
drifted and needs updating, not the other way around.

`CommunicationProfile` values are stored here because they were
explicitly approved as immutable per-identity metadata (user_onboarding
approval), but **nothing in this codebase reads them yet** -- no
Decision phrasing, no Relationship/Decision Engine, no communication
layer exists to consume them. They exist purely as validated,
available data for whenever that future, separately-approved work
begins.
