InMemoryWorkingMemory -- process-lifetime, per-subject working memory.
Precise lifetime contract (not a weaker or stronger claim than this):

- Survives multiple messages from the same subject within one process run.
- NOT separated by Discord channel, guild, or conversation session --
  `subject_key` is the only dimension.
- A process restart wipes it completely.
- It is neither long-term memory nor session-identified memory -- no
  session ID or session lifecycle exists here, and none is added
  without a demonstrated need.

Privacy contract: non-persistent does not mean non-sensitive. This
class stores only the raw text of an already-validated user message
and its already-validated assistant response, plus which role each
turn belongs to -- nothing else. No commands, no onboarding messages,
no fallback responses, no system prompt/instructions, no identity
profile, no consent/audit/Discord-message/provider ID, no exception
text, no internal metadata. Raw content is never logged -- this module
does not log at all.
