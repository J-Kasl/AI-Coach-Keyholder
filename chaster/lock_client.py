chaster/lock_client.py

ChasterLockClient -- a narrow resource client for the two confirmed
Chaster Public API operations this project's emergency-unlock safety
plane needs. Deliberately separate from `chaster/oauth_client.py`
(authorization-code/refresh-token exchange only) -- this client makes
resource API calls with an already-obtained bearer access token, a
genuinely different concern.

Confirmed directly from the official OpenAPI specification
(https://api.chaster.app/api-json, re-fetched during this project's
own research):

- GET /locks -- operationId LockController_findAll, "Get user locks".
  "Returns a list of all user locks. By default, only active locks
  are returned." Optional `status` query param (enum: active,
  archived, all; default active) -- confirmed, official, used here
  explicitly rather than relying only on the documented default.
  Response: array of LockForWearer. Scope: locks.
- POST /locks/{lockId}/emergency-unlock -- operationId
  LockController_emergencyUnlock, "Emergency-unlock a bondage lock".
  "Wearer-only safety release that bypasses the normal unlock
  constraints; requires at least one safety feature enabled in the
  bondage config." Responses: 204 success, 400 (not a bondage lock /
  no safety feature enabled / not locked), 401, 403 (non-wearer),
  404. Scope: locks.

NOT confirmed from any authoritative first-party source (see
chaster/emergency_unlock_provider.py's own header docstring): the
exact field-level JSON schema of a `LockForWearer` object (its id
field, lock-type field, bondage-config field, and their exact names).
This client therefore returns each lock as a raw, unparsed `dict` --
it does not guess field names. See `unconfirmed_lock_field_extractor`
in emergency_unlock_provider.py for where that gap is isolated.

Never logs the access token; never includes it in an exception
message.
