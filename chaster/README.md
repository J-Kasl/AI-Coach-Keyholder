# Chaster

Canonical design: `docs/architecture/chaster_integration_technical_design.md`
(**`Draft for review`** — HTTP callback architecture and the
encryption/key-management architecture are approved at the
architecture level; this README describes exactly what has actually
been implemented: **CHASTER-01A** (OAuth Connection Foundation, plus
the real emergency-unlock safety plane) and **CHASTER-01B, Increments
1–3** (the provider observation log and its on-demand fetch service).
**CHASTER-01B Increment 4** (a conversation-engine context provider
reading these observations) is explicitly **not** built — see
"What is NOT implemented" below.

## Epistemic invariant — read this first

> **Chaster-reported state is `PROVIDER_REPORTED`/`ChasterProviderStatus`
> state — never `VERIFIED`, and never merged with `lock_state`'s own
> user-reported state.**

Chaster's API can confirm what its own system was told, never whether
a lock is *physically* secured. `ChasterProviderStatus` (`locked` /
`unlocked` / `deserted`) exists specifically so this distinction is
visible at the type level, not just in prose — no `VERIFIED` member
exists, or ever will. Provider observations and `lock_state`'s own
`lock_reports` are stored in structurally separate tables, with no
foreign key between them, and are never reconciled into one combined
value — see `docs/architecture/chaster_integration_technical_design.md`
Section 15 ("Conflict with user-reported state").

## What is implemented — CHASTER-01A (OAuth Connection Foundation)

- **`models.py`** — `ChasterOAuthState`, `ChasterConnection`,
  `ConnectionStatus` (exactly two values: `active` /
  `needs_reauthorization` — every other conceptual state is
  represented structurally: row absence = not connected/disconnected,
  a `chaster_oauth_states` row with no matching `chaster_connections`
  row = authorization in progress, a transparent refresh attempt =
  not a stored state at all). `ChasterConnection.__repr__` is
  overridden to redact both encrypted token fields.
- **`token_encryptor.py`** — `TokenEncryptor`, the ONLY place in this
  codebase that imports `cryptography.fernet`. Fails fast (at
  construction) on a missing/invalid master key — never generates a
  replacement. Deliberately never passes `ttl=` to `Fernet.decrypt()`
  — see the module's own docstring for why.
- **`repository.py`** — `ChasterOAuthStateRepository` (single-use
  `state` values, atomic consume via `Database.transaction()`'s own
  `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, proven with real concurrent threads in this
  module's own tests) and `ChasterConnectionRepository` (owns the
  encryption boundary — callers only ever see plaintext at this
  layer's own edges, never ciphertext). Token refresh is NOT
  automatic here — `get_decrypted_access_token()` never checks
  expiry itself; `chaster/provider_observation_service.py` (below) is
  the one caller that performs the check-then-refresh-then-persist
  orchestration.
- **`_http.py`** — `send_with_ordered_headers()`, the single shared
  transport every real Chaster HTTP call in this project goes
  through. Exists because Chaster's own API/Cloudflare edge rejects
  `requests`' default header ordering (`Authorization` appended
  last) — confirmed by direct, reproducible, real testing against the
  live endpoint. Reorders `Authorization`/`User-Agent` to the front,
  preserves every other header `requests` itself needs (e.g.
  `Content-Type` for a form body) unchanged.
- **`oauth_client.py`** — `ChasterOAuthClient`, built only from the
  two officially confirmed endpoints (Authorization, Token) plus the
  confirmed `GET /auth/profile` (`fetch_raw_profile()` — used by both
  the real identity resolver below and a manual diagnostic script;
  see its own docstring). Never logs or echoes a code/token/secret in
  any exception message.
- **`callback_service.py`** — `ChasterCallbackService`, the
  framework-agnostic orchestration: consume state → exchange code →
  resolve identity → persist. **Identity resolution is now real**:
  `build_real_identity_resolver()`, evidence-backed by a real,
  complete, verbatim `GET /auth/profile` response (see the design
  doc's own full diagnostic history), reads exactly the two fields
  `ChasterIdentity` needs (`_id`, `username`) out of the ~90-field
  real response — nothing else. Fails closed on a missing/wrong-type
  `_id`. `unconfirmed_identity_resolver` (the old, always-raising
  placeholder) remains in the module as a test fixture only — the
  same pattern `UnwiredEmergencyUnlockProvider` already established.
- **`callback_listener.py`** — `ChasterCallbackListener`, the ONLY
  `aiohttp.web` server in this project. One route
  (`/oauth/chaster/callback`), localhost-only bind. Started/stopped
  by `bot/discord_bot.py::CoachKeyholderBot.setup_hook()`/`close()` —
  a startup failure here is caught and logged, never allowed to
  prevent Discord itself from starting.

## What is implemented — CHASTER-01B, Increments 1–3

- **Migration `023`** — `chaster_provider_observations`
  (`id`, `connection_id` REFERENCES `chaster_connections(user_id)`,
  `provider`, `chaster_lock_id` nullable, `status`, `fetched_at`,
  `created_at`), plus `idx_chaster_provider_observations_connection_fetched`
  on `(connection_id, fetched_at DESC)` for the one read pattern that
  matters ("the most recent observation for this connection").
  Append-only, structurally separate from `lock_reports` (migration
  019) — no foreign key between them, confirmed directly via
  `PRAGMA foreign_key_list`, not just by design intent.
- **`models.py`** — `ChasterProviderStatus` (exactly `locked` /
  `unlocked` / `deserted`, matching the confirmed official
  `LockStatusEnum` — see the epistemic invariant above) and
  `ChasterProviderObservation`.
- **`provider_observation_repository.py`** — `ChasterProviderObservations`
  (read-only, `get_latest()`) and `ChasterProviderObservationRecorder`
  (append-only write — always an INSERT, never an UPDATE/DELETE).
  Real concurrent-write safety proven with real threads, the same
  discipline `chaster_oauth_states`' own tests already established.
- **`provider_observation_service.py`** — `ChasterProviderObservationService.fetch_and_record()`,
  the on-demand fetch workflow (connection lookup → token-expiry
  check → transparent refresh + persist if needed →
  `ChasterLockClient.list_active_locks()` → parse → record). **No
  scheduler, no background thread, no asyncio task, no timer** — a
  single synchronous call, triggered by a future caller (a Discord
  command, not built in this increment). Returns
  `FetchObservationResult` (an outcome + the best available
  observation), not a bare `Observation | None` — Section 14's
  failure taxonomy needs to stay distinguishable at the type level:
  - `RECORDED` / `ZERO_ACTIVE_LOCKS` — a fresh observation.
    Zero active locks is recorded as `unlocked` — a real, positive
    report *from* the provider, structurally different from
    inferring "unlocked" from missing/failed data.
  - `NO_CONNECTION`, `NEEDS_REAUTHORIZATION`, `API_UNAVAILABLE` — the
    live fetch could not happen or the token could not be refreshed;
    `observation` carries the **last known** observation (its own
    real `fetched_at`, never rewritten to look fresh) if one exists,
    `None` otherwise. None of these ever imply `unlocked`.
  - `AMBIGUOUS_MULTIPLE_LOCKS` — more than one active lock; the
    model holds exactly one lock's status per row, so this fails
    closed rather than picking one arbitrarily (mirrors
    `emergency_unlock_provider.py`'s own established discipline for
    a structurally different reason).
  - `UNPARSEABLE_STATUS` — the real `status` field's value didn't
    match any of the three confirmed enum members. This project has
    directly confirmed the field's *type* (`str`) from a real
    response, but never directly confirmed every real *value* always
    matches the documented enum — an unexpected value is an honest
    parse failure, never guessed at or coerced to a default.

## What is NOT implemented

- **CHASTER-01B Increment 4** — a conversation-engine context
  provider reading `chaster_provider_observations`. Deliberately,
  explicitly deferred: wiring live/persisted Chaster data into
  `assemble_context()`'s prompt pipeline is its own decision, gated
  separately from the rest of CHASTER-01B, per this project's own
  review turn on the subject.
- Any change to `lock_state`'s user-reported model or `task_runtime`'s
  eligibility logic — both completely untouched, confirmed by direct
  inspection every time CHASTER-01B work has touched anything nearby.
- `chaster disconnect` / `chaster status` commands (no Discord-facing
  command reads a provider observation yet — that would be part of
  or downstream of Increment 4).
- Key rotation tooling (`encryption_key_version` is reserved,
  unused, always `NULL`).
- **`LockForWearer`'s exact field-level JSON schema is now
  confirmed** for a real account's real active locks (43 top-level
  keys, including `_id`, `status`, `lockType`, `extensions` — see the
  design doc's own diagnostic history) — but
  `emergency_unlock_provider.py::unconfirmed_lock_field_extractor`,
  the function the **emergency-unlock path specifically** relies on,
  has **not** been updated to use this now-confirmed schema and still
  always raises. The confirmed schema is what
  `provider_observation_service.py` (above) is built against;
  emergency-unlock's own eligibility-check step remains a distinct,
  still-open piece of work.
- Real Chaster account identity resolution — **now resolved**, see
  `callback_service.py` above (kept here as a crossed-out item for
  changelog continuity — no longer a real gap).

## PC-local emergency-unlock safety plane

A **separate, standalone process** — `chaster/emergency_unlock_server.py`
(`python3 -m chaster.emergency_unlock_server`), never imported by or
importing `bot/discord_bot.py`, `application/`, or
`conversation_engine/` — confirmed by this project's own tests via
actual AST-parsed import statements, not a docstring claim. Exists
so the safety mechanism stays usable even if the Discord bot process
itself is hung, crashed, or otherwise malfunctioning.

- **`lock_client.py`** — `ChasterLockClient`: the two confirmed
  Chaster endpoints this safety plane needs (`GET /locks`,
  `POST /locks/{lockId}/emergency-unlock`), both now routed through
  `_http.py::send_with_ordered_headers()`. Returns each lock as a
  raw, unparsed `dict` — deliberately does not guess field names.
- **`emergency_unlock_provider.py`** — `RealChasterEmergencyUnlockProvider`:
  the real, tested Option A control flow (discover → enforce
  exactly-one → check eligibility → call the confirmed endpoint for
  that one lock only). `EmergencyUnlockProvider.attempt_unlock(access_token)`'s
  signature is unchanged — no caller can ever supply a lock ID.
  `UnwiredEmergencyUnlockProvider` remains as a test-only,
  network-inert fixture. The eligibility-check step still calls
  `unconfirmed_lock_field_extractor` (see above) and so still fails
  safely rather than guessing.
- **`emergency_unlock.py`** — `EmergencyUnlockService`: authenticates
  against a dedicated secret (`CHASTER_EMERGENCY_UNLOCK_SECRET`,
  never reused from any other Chaster secret), writes an audit event
  at every stage by reusing the existing `infrastructure.outbox`
  domain-events table (no new migration), decrypts the access token
  only immediately before a provider call.
- **`emergency_unlock_listener.py`** — its own separate
  `aiohttp.web.Application`, localhost-only, one route.
- **`emergency_unlock_server.py`** — the standalone entry point;
  refuses to start without both the emergency secret and the token
  encryption key configured.

**Deployment gate (unchanged): real personal Chaster deployment
remains blocked until a real, confirmed unlock operation exists and
has itself been thoroughly tested — this safety plane being
implemented and locally tested does not itself clear that gate.**

## Configuration

All new `.env` values are optional — the bot starts normally, and
`chaster connect` replies that Chaster is "not configured," if any
piece is missing:

- `CHASTER_CLIENT_ID`, `CHASTER_REDIRECT_URI` (non-secret)
- `CHASTER_CALLBACK_BIND_HOST` (default `127.0.0.1`), `CHASTER_CALLBACK_BIND_PORT` (default `8420`) (non-secret)
- `CHASTER_CLIENT_SECRET`, `CHASTER_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (secrets — generate the encryption key with
  `python3 -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"`,
  then back it up **separately from the database** — losing one
  without the other makes every stored connection permanently
  undecryptable)

## Testability

- **Milestone A** (pure local, mocked Chaster HTTP): `tests/chaster/`
  — fully exercised, no domain/Cloudflare/real Chaster application
  needed. 349 tests across this package alone as of CHASTER-01B
  Increment 3.
- **Milestone B** (real local listener, no Cloudflare):
  `tests/chaster/test_callback_listener.py`,
  `tests/bot/test_chaster_listener_lifecycle.py` — a real `aiohttp`
  server, real HTTP requests, still entirely local.
- **Milestone C** (real OAuth through a real tunnel + a real,
  approved Chaster application): **still not achievable** — no
  longer blocked on identity resolution (now implemented), but
  Cloudflare Tunnel has never been set up, and `chaster_connections`
  has never been populated by a real, completed `chaster connect`
  flow. Every real request made against the live Chaster API so far
  (transport diagnostics, schema confirmation, this service's own
  manual smoke tests) has used a developer token entered by hand,
  never the production OAuth path. **All application-level code this
  milestone needs already exists and is already tested** — the
  `chaster connect` Discord command (`application/service.py::_handle_chaster_connect`),
  the callback receiver (`chaster/callback_listener.py` +
  `chaster/callback_service.py`, including real identity resolution
  and encrypted persistence) — none of it needed new code. What
  remains is entirely external: `docs/deployment/cloudflare_tunnel_config_template.yml`
  documents the exact `cloudflared` ingress configuration needed
  (one hostname → port 8420 only; port 8421, the emergency listener,
  must never appear in any tunnel ingress rule), and
  `scripts/dev_callback_listener_readiness_check.py` verifies the
  local listener itself is ready to receive tunnel-forwarded traffic
  — but neither substitutes for actually running `cloudflared`,
  registering the resulting public URL with a real, approved Chaster
  developer application, and completing one real `chaster connect`
  by hand.

## Current real-provider readiness (checkpoint status)

- **Option A is selected** for emergency-unlock target-lock semantics
  and is **implemented**: active-lock discovery happens live, at the
  moment of each emergency request, via the confirmed `GET
  /locks?status=active` — never from a cached or stale value.
- **Exactly one active lock is required.** Zero active locks fails
  safely (`"No active Chaster lock found"`); more than one fails
  safely with the exact candidate count, never picking one
  arbitrarily.
- **No caller can ever supply a `lockId`.** `EmergencyUnlockProvider.attempt_unlock(access_token)`'s
  signature has no lock parameter at all — selection happens entirely
  inside `RealChasterEmergencyUnlockProvider`.
- **The confirmed `POST /locks/{lockId}/emergency-unlock` endpoint is
  used**, with the documented bondage-lock + enabled-safety-feature
  eligibility requirement enforced before any unlock is attempted —
  though note the real, confirmed account used throughout this
  project's own diagnostics has `lockType: "chastity"`, not
  `"bondage"`, so this endpoint's documented prerequisite may not
  apply to that lock at all; this has not been reconciled.
- **`LockForWearer`'s top-level field schema is now confirmed** (see
  "What is NOT implemented" above) for real active locks on one real
  account — but the emergency-unlock eligibility-check step itself
  has not yet been updated to use it; `unconfirmed_lock_field_extractor`
  still always raises there.
- **`CurrentUser`'s exact field schema is now confirmed** — a real,
  complete, verbatim `GET /auth/profile` response was captured and
  used to build `callback_service.py::build_real_identity_resolver()`
  (above).
- **The real provider transport has been proven against a real
  Chaster account** — real `GET /locks?status=active` and real `GET
  /auth/profile` calls, through the actual production
  `ChasterLockClient`/`ChasterOAuthClient` (including the header-
  ordering fix), have both returned real HTTP 200 responses with
  real data, confirmed via a dev-only production-client smoke test.
  The real emergency-unlock POST itself has still never been
  exercised against a real account.
- **Cloudflare Tunnel is still not implemented** — Milestone C
  (real OAuth end-to-end) remains unreachable for that reason alone.
- **The local emergency safety-plane deployment gate remains open.**
  No real personal Chaster deployment should occur yet.
