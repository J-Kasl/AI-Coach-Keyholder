docs/architecture/chaster_integration_technical_design.md (draft, not
approved for implementation as a whole -- see chaster/README.md for
the exact CHASTER-01A boundary this module implements).

Two structurally separate classes, the same split
task_catalog/lock_state/advanced_mode already established:

- `ChasterOAuthStateRepository` -- pending, single-use OAuth `state`
  values. No encryption (chaster_integration_technical_design.md
  Section 10/21) -- unguessability, not database confidentiality, is
  this table's own security property.
- `ChasterConnectionRepository` -- durable, encrypted-at-rest OAuth
  connections. Owns the encryption boundary: callers pass/receive
  PLAINTEXT tokens only; this class is the only thing that ever calls
  TokenEncryptor.encrypt()/.decrypt(), immediately before a write or
  immediately after a read -- application/service code above this
  layer never touches ciphertext directly.
