chaster/_http.py

Internal helper -- narrow, Chaster-specific, not a general HTTP
framework. Every real Chaster HTTP call in this project must go
through `send_with_ordered_headers()` rather than calling
`requests.get()`/`requests.post()` directly.

WHY THIS EXISTS: `requests` merges its own default headers
(`User-Agent`, `Accept-Encoding`, `Accept`, `Connection` --
`requests.utils.default_headers()`) into a request's final header set
*first*; any caller-supplied header that isn't already one of those
defaults -- `Authorization`, in every Chaster call -- gets appended
*last*, regardless of the order the caller's own `headers=` dict was
written in. This is `requests`' own architecture (confirmed via
`Session.prepare_request()` / `merge_setting()`), not fixable through
the plain `headers=` keyword argument alone.

Chaster's own API/Cloudflare edge rejects requests with this default
ordering (`Authorization` last) -- confirmed by direct, real,
reproducible testing against the live endpoint: an otherwise-identical
request succeeds (HTTP 200) once `Authorization` and `User-Agent` are
moved to the front of the header sequence, and fails (HTTP 400)
otherwise. Every other header-*value* hypothesis (removing
`Accept-Encoding`, removing `Accept`, setting `Connection: close`) was
independently tested and ruled out first -- see
docs/architecture/chaster_integration_technical_design.md for the
full diagnostic history. Order, not presence or value, is the
confirmed differentiator.

This helper reorders rather than strips: every header `requests`
itself needs to add (e.g. `Content-Type`/`Content-Length` for a form
body) is preserved, only moved to come after `Authorization`/
`User-Agent` instead of before.
