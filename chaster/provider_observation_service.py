chaster/provider_observation_service.py

docs/architecture/chaster_integration_technical_design.md, Section
25a Milestone D / Section 26 (CHASTER-01B Increment 3). On-demand
fetch only -- no scheduler, no background thread, no asyncio task,
no timer (Section 16, "Polling": this project has no such
infrastructure for anything, and none is introduced here). A single
synchronous call, triggered explicitly by a future caller (a Discord
command, not built in this increment).

Composes, in order: connection lookup -> token-expiry check ->
transparent refresh if needed -> `ChasterLockClient.list_active_locks()`
(already routed through the confirmed `send_with_ordered_headers()`
transport) -> parse -> record via `ChasterProviderObservationRecorder`.

DELIBERATE DEVIATION FROM THE LITERAL `ChasterProviderObservation |
None` SIGNATURE REQUESTED: returns `FetchObservationResult` instead
-- a small (outcome, observation) pair. A bare `None` cannot
distinguish "no connection exists" from "token refresh failed" from
"the live fetch failed but here's what we knew before" from
"multiple active locks, cannot safely record one" -- and Section 14
requires each of these be handled honestly and distinctly, not
collapsed into one undifferentiated failure. `observation` carries
the freshly recorded row on success, or the LAST KNOWN observation
(with its own real, un-touched `fetched_at`) on any failure where one
exists -- so a caller can always show "here is the last thing we
knew, and how old it is" per Section 14's own language, never a
default assumption in either direction.

NOT wired into `assemble_context()` or any prompt builder -- that
remains its own, separately-gated decision. `task_runtime/eligibility.py`
and `lock_state/` are not imported or touched anywhere in this file.
