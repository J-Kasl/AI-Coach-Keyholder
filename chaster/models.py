chaster/models.py

docs/architecture/chaster_integration_technical_design.md. This
module implements CHASTER-01A's own data shapes (OAuth connection
foundation) plus CHASTER-01B Increment 2's own data shape (the
provider observation log, migration 023) -- still no lock fetching
beyond what CHASTER-01A's emergency-unlock provider already does, no
context-provider wiring (that remains explicitly deferred, gated on
its own separate decision).

Entities, all genuinely one-row-per-user or append-only-per-connection
(never accumulated-without-bound in a way that loses the "current
state is the latest row" read pattern -- see task_catalog/README.md's
own "id vs. user_id as PK" reasoning this module mirrors for the same
structural reason `user_preferences` already uses it):

- ChasterOAuthState -- a pending, single-use OAuth `state` value.
  Replaced (never accumulated) by a new `chaster connect`; consumed
  exactly once by a real callback.
- ChasterConnection -- a durable, encrypted-at-rest OAuth connection.
  `connection_status` has exactly two values -- see
  ConnectionStatus's own docstring for why the design deliberately
  does NOT add more.
- ChasterProviderObservation -- one row per real `GET /locks` fetch,
  append-only (mirrors lock_state's own `lock_reports` discipline --
  migration 019 -- structurally separate, never merged). Represents
  what Chaster's own API reported, at the moment it was fetched --
  PROVIDER-OBSERVED, never "verified" (see ChasterProviderStatus's
  own docstring for why VERIFIED is not, and will never be, a value
  here).

    connected", "disconnected", "authorization in progress", "token
    refresh required") is represented structurally instead of as a
    stored value here:
    - "not connected"/"disconnected": no ChasterConnection row exists
      at all -- absence of a row IS the state, not a status value.
    - "authorization in progress": lives exclusively in
      ChasterOAuthState, never here -- the two entities are never
      both "about" the same in-progress attempt at once.

      is attempted transparently at the moment a token is needed) --
      never persisted. Only if the refresh itself fails does the
      status change, to NEEDS_REAUTHORIZATION.
    - "unusable/corrupt credentials" (e.g. TokenDecryptionError):
