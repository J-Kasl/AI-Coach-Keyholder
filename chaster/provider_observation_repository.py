chaster/provider_observation_repository.py

docs/architecture/chaster_integration_technical_design.md, Section
25a Milestone D / Section 26 (CHASTER-01B Increment 2). Two
structurally separate public classes, the same read/write split
`lock_state/repository.py` already established for the same reason:

- `ChasterProviderObservations` -- read-only (`get_latest`). No write
  method exists on this class.
- `ChasterProviderObservationRecorder` -- the only way a row is ever
  written to `chaster_provider_observations` -- always an INSERT,
  never an UPDATE or DELETE (append-only, migration 023's own
  invariant, mirroring migration 019's `lock_reports`).

Deliberately NOT a general public write API a Discord command could
call directly -- CHASTER-01B's own on-demand fetch service (a later
increment) is the only intended caller of the recorder, since a
"provider observation" is a machine-fetched fact, not a user-supplied
one (no consent-id concept applies here the way it does for
`lock_state`'s own governed write).
