# AI Coach & Keyholder

A personal, local AI system combining a long-term coach with a
consistency/accountability system. See [`philosophy.md`](philosophy.md)
for the principles every decision and every future change must satisfy,
and [`docs/architecture/`](docs/architecture/) for the full
architecture baseline (nine technical designs + an integration audit +
implementation conventions -- all with status *Architecture baseline --
approved for implementation*).

## Architecture at a glance

The system is event-driven: domain modules never call each other's
internals directly. Each module owns its own state, publishes domain
events when that state changes, and reacts to other modules' events
through narrow, named consumer handlers -- never by reaching into
another module's tables or opening a second database transaction
mid-reaction. See `implementation_conventions.md` Section 3 and
`system/README.md` for the precise rules this follows, including a real
constraint (`NestedTransactionError`) discovered while wiring the first
cross-module consumer, and how it shaped every consumer written since.

The current, fully implemented lifecycle:

```
Incident (Trust Manager)
    │  confirmed
    ▼
Trust Score (recalculation pipeline)
    │  incident.confirmation_changed
    ▼
Penalty Window (Penalty Engine)
    │  should_extend() -- Extension
    ▼
Recovery Plan
    │  task completed
    ▼
Recovery Credit (back into Penalty Engine)
```

Three domain modules (Trust Manager, Penalty Engine, Recovery Plan) and
one composition layer (`system/`) exist today, fully wired together
through real, tested events -- not mocks. Each module's own README
documents exactly what it covers, what's deliberately deferred, and any
real architectural findings surfaced while building it:

- [`trust_manager/README.md`](trust_manager/README.md) -- Incident
  lifecycle, confirmation, severity assessment, the trust score
  recalculation pipeline.
- [`penalty_engine/README.md`](penalty_engine/README.md) -- the
  PenaltyWindow state machine, freeze-as-a-set-of-reasons, Extension
  (`should_extend()`), and Recovery Credit.
- [`recovery_plan/README.md`](recovery_plan/README.md) -- the Recovery
  Plan lifecycle as a pure reaction to Penalty Window events, plus
  Coach-facing task management.
- [`system/README.md`](system/README.md) -- the startup orchestrator,
  the consumer/dispatch framework, and the composition-layer wiring
  between all of the above.
- [`infrastructure/README.md`](infrastructure/README.md) -- the shared
  `Clock`, `Database`/`Transaction`, and transactional outbox that
  every module above is built on.

## Project status

**869 passing tests** across the whole repository (`pytest`), including
two repository-wide guard tests: one that mechanically confirms no
production code outside `infrastructure/clock.py` calls
`datetime.now()`/`datetime.utcnow()` directly, and one that confirms
every `BOOTSTRAP_DEFAULT`-tagged constant uses the agreed structured
form (`tests/test_bootstrap_default_tags.py` — see "Bootstrap defaults"
in `trust_manager/README.md` and `penalty_engine/README.md`).

Eighteen sequential database migrations are applied so far
(`database/migrations/001` through `018`), covering the initial Phase 0
schema, the transactional outbox, Trust Manager, the trust
recalculation pipeline, Penalty Engine, the startup lease, Extension,
Recovery Plan, Recovery Credit, Goal Management, the application
layer's user identity bookkeeping, the plugin infrastructure's own
scoped migration tracking, Discord onboarding/user preferences, (014)
the Task Catalog reference layer, (015/016) its consent/timestamp
audit columns, (017) Advanced Mode's `OperatingMode` singleton and
two-stage transition process, and (018) its `INVALIDATED` status
(a `source_mode` mismatch found under direct review). See
[`database/migrations/README.md`](database/migrations/README.md) for
the hard rule migrations must follow (never destructive to user data).

**User-verified working on Windows with Python 3.14.6** (see the
"Python version" note above) — the full suite, a real Discord Gateway
connection, and an end-to-end DM session (including onboarding) have
all been confirmed there.

### Implementation order so far

13. ~~Goal Management (lifecycle, evidence, evaluation, the `GoalChangeProposal` confirmation mechanism)~~ **done (Phase 2.9)**
14. ~~First usable vertical slice: `application/` + a thin Discord adapter~~ **done (Phase 3.1)**
15. ~~Plugin Infrastructure, Step 1: `plugin_sdk.py` + `plugin_fault_boundary.py`, zero real plugins yet~~ **done**
16. ~~Plugin Infrastructure, Step 2: `plugin_registry.py` (discovery, manifest validation, wiring into `ConsumerRegistry`/`CommandRouter`), zero real plugins yet~~ **done**
17. ~~Plugin Infrastructure, Step 3: `plugins/goal_celebration`, the first real plugin, plus `plugin_migrations.py`~~ **done**
18. ~~Discord onboarding + persistent user preferences: language → AI gender → personality, the 15-identity catalog as approved reference data, `windows/` Task Scheduler deployment~~ **done** — see `docs/architecture/user_onboarding_technical_design.md`.
19. ~~Task Catalog, catalog-layer-only implementation slice: `TaskTemplateVersion`/`TaskTemplateCatalogEntry`, read-only `TaskCatalog` + governance-only `TaskCatalogAdministration`~~ **done** — see `task_catalog/README.md` for the exact boundary (no task instance, no Task Runtime, no role owners assigned).
20. ~~Advanced Mode, `OperatingMode`-only implementation slice: the global singleton, the two-stage `critical_change` transition process (`AdvancedMode` read-only + `AdvancedModeAdministration` write), the new `penalty_engine` transaction-scoped read this required~~ **done** — see `advanced_mode/README.md` for the exact boundary (no `DelegatedAuthorityPolicy`, no Penalty Window max, no tokens, no Hygiene values, no Task assignment).
21. ~~Advanced Mode's transition process wired into Discord DM: `mode`/`mode status`/`mode request advanced`/`mode request standard`/`mode cancel`/`mode confirm`, `IncomingMessage.external_message_id`, explicit settle-before-act orchestration~~ **done** — see `application/README.md` for the exact boundary (this project's first write-capable Discord commands).
22. ~~Conversation Engine, Slice 1 only: runtime types and a deterministic safety shell (`ResponseCategory`, `ConversationContextProvider`/`Fragment`, `ResponseContextSnapshot`, `ResponsePlan`, `ConversationResponse`, structural validation, deterministic fallback)~~ **done** — see `conversation_engine/README.md` for the exact boundary (no LLM, no ordinary conversation, no `ApplicationService` integration, today's Discord behavior completely unchanged).
23. ~~Conversation Engine, Slice 2: real Ollama-backed ordinary conversation for unmatched text only, ticket-based per-subject FIFO queue, transitional in-memory recent-history buffer, `Database`'s thread-local transaction guard fix~~ **done** — see `conversation_engine/README.md` for the exact boundary (no Memory System, no tool calling, no `GOVERNANCE_EXPLANATION`, no provider registry).
24. ~~Memory System, non-persistent Working Memory foundation slice only: `WorkingMemoryRole`/`WorkingMemoryTurn`/`WorkingMemorySnapshot`, `WorkingMemoryReader`/`WorkingMemoryWriter` protocols, `InMemoryWorkingMemory` (process-lifetime, per-subject, atomic whole-exchange commit, oldest-whole-exchange trimming, thread-safe, no FIFO of its own)~~ **done** — see `memory_system/README.md` for the exact boundary (no persistence, no migration, all four remaining memory layers still blocked on an unwritten privacy/consent design).
25. ~~Conversation Engine Slice 3: wired `ConversationEngine` to `memory_system`'s `InMemoryWorkingMemory` via `WorkingMemoryReader`/`WorkingMemoryWriter` (separate, injected dependencies), removed `TransitionalRecentMessageBuffer` entirely, explicit read/write failure policies with distinct log codes for expected vs. unexpected failures~~ **done** — see `conversation_engine/README.md`'s own "Slice 3" section for the exact boundary (same process-lifetime/no-persistence contract as before, mechanical cutover of the same 10-exchange/8000-character limits, no `ConversationContextProvider` integration despite the original design text).
26. ~~Preference & Limits Profile, Foundation Slice 1 only: pure process-independent domain model (`ProfileOwnerKey`, `ProfileTopicId`, `ProfileDisposition`, `ProfileEntry`, `PreferenceProfileSnapshot`, `TopicState`, `resolve_topic_state()`), at-most-one-active-entry-per-topic cardinality enforced constructionally~~ **done** — see `preference_profile/README.md` for the exact boundary (no repository, no persistence, no import/consent/eligibility integration, no age-gate Protocol, zero runtime wiring anywhere in the project).

### Roadmap — three explicitly separate tiers

Reflecting a real correction: an earlier revision of this README listed
`memory_system_technical_design.md` under "approved" despite that
document's own header saying the opposite, and undercounted the
migration total by two. Both are fixed here, and this section now
keeps three tiers visibly distinct so that mistake doesn't recur
silently:

**1. Just implemented (this revision):** Advanced Mode's `OperatingMode`-only
slice — the global singleton and its two-stage `critical_change`
transition process (`docs/architecture/advanced_mode_technical_design.md`;
**the document as a whole remains draft, not approved for
implementation** — only the specific slice `advanced_mode/README.md`
itself describes has actually been built; item 20 above). Required one
small, confirmed-before-implementation change outside the new module:
`penalty_engine`'s own `get_active_or_frozen_penalty_window_in_transaction(tx)`.

**Previously implemented, same standard:** Task Catalog's catalog-layer
slice — versioned, append-only task templates and their governance
(`docs/architecture/task_catalog_technical_design.md`; **the document
as a whole remains draft, not approved for implementation** — only the
specific slice `task_catalog/README.md` itself describes has actually
been built; item 19 above).

**2. Approved, but deliberately deferred:** transaction-aware SDK read
methods (`plugin_architecture_proposal.md` v1.5 Section 26 Open
Question 6 — the direction is decided, the implementation is not yet
built; still not started).

**3. Drafts awaiting their own separate approval — not a queue of
what gets built next:**
- [`docs/architecture/memory_system_technical_design.md`](docs/architecture/memory_system_technical_design.md)
  (v1.4) — **draft, NOT approved for implementation.** The five memory
  layers, a single-source-of-truth table per information category, an
  explicit ownership model. Implementation not started, not queued.
- [`docs/architecture/relationship_decision_engine_technical_design.md`](docs/architecture/relationship_decision_engine_technical_design.md)
  (v1.1) — **draft, NOT approved for implementation.** How Domain
  State becomes one unified `Decision`, via a Relationship Engine
  (Coach/Keyholder as two interpretive perspectives, not two
  independent agents) and a Decision Engine (Entitlement Classes, the
  Hidden Token Economy).
- [`docs/architecture/ai_identity_technical_design.md`](docs/architecture/ai_identity_technical_design.md)
  (v1.0) — **draft, NOT approved for implementation**, *except* for
  Sections 3 and 10 specifically, which `user_onboarding_technical_design.md`
  cites as approved, stable reference data (the 15-identity catalog
  and the six communication-profile values) — the communication
  pipeline itself (phrasing a `Decision` in an identity's voice) is
  still fully unapproved.
- [`docs/architecture/advanced_mode_technical_design.md`](docs/architecture/advanced_mode_technical_design.md)
  (v1.0) — **draft, NOT approved for implementation as a whole**,
  *except* for Section 2 (`OperatingMode` itself) and Section 11 (the
  transition state machine), implemented for exactly that slice, item
  20 above (with two refinements found during implementation review —
  see the document's own notes at the start of each section). Every
  other section — `DelegatedAuthorityPolicy`, the token transparency
  exception, `MAX_TARGET_ACTIVE_HOURS` as a function of mode, Hygiene
  values, Carry Bank, Task Runtime conditions — remains fully open,
  unimplemented, and unapproved.
- [`docs/architecture/task_catalog_technical_design.md`](docs/architecture/task_catalog_technical_design.md)
  (v1.0) — **draft, NOT approved for implementation as a whole**,
  *except* for the specific catalog-layer slice `task_catalog/README.md`
  describes (TC-1/TC-2/TC-4/TC-8's data shapes) — approved and
  implemented for exactly that slice, item 19 above. Everything else
  in the document (which future domain owns each `TaskInstanceRole`,
  whether a Task Runtime should ever exist, `SourceReference`,
  `binding_conditions_snapshot`) remains fully open, unimplemented,
  and unassigned.

**Already approved and implemented, not drafts:**
[`docs/architecture/plugin_architecture_proposal.md`](docs/architecture/plugin_architecture_proposal.md)
(v1.5, Steps 1–3 done — see `infrastructure/README.md`) and
[`docs/architecture/user_onboarding_technical_design.md`](docs/architecture/user_onboarding_technical_design.md)
(v1.0, done in full — see its own Section 9).

`philosophy.md` v1.16 already reflects one decision from this line of
work (Section 4.2: the Hidden Token Economy replaces an earlier,
never-implemented visible-token model) — see its own revision history
for the reasoning.

### Phase 0 foundation (unchanged since the original design)

- Directory structure (`core/`, `ai/`, `database/`, `bot/`,
  `integrations/`, `observations/`).
- `database/models.py` -- the original dataclass contracts
  (ContextSnapshot, CoachAssessment, KeyholderAssessment,
  DecisionResult, ObservationRecord, Rule, ConsentRecord, ...).
- `database/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql` -- the SQLite schema
  (hybrid: normalized fields + JSON, rule versioning, consent_log,
  observations).
- `database/database.py` -- the access layer (migrations + save/get for
  every entity), later rebuilt in Phase 1.2 to compose on top of
  `infrastructure.database.Database` rather than managing its own
  connections.
- `core/config.py` -- loading configuration and secrets from `.env`.
- `database/backup.py` -- backups via SQLite's online backup API, at
  most 1 automatic daily backup, always a backup before applying a
  migration (if the DB already had some schema version), simple
  rotation (default: the 14 most recent backups,
  `BACKUP_RETENTION_COUNT` in `.env`).
- `bot/discord_bot.py` -- a basic Discord bot: connects, logs messages
  to short-term memory, **no AI logic yet** (arrives in Phase 1+).

All of the above was tested end-to-end (round-trip save/load for every
entity, bot import and initialization, backup scenarios including the
daily limit, pre-migration backups, and rotation).

**Data and backup policy (verified):**
- User data (`data/coach_keyholder.db`, `data/backups/`) is outside git
  (`.gitignore`) -- updating the application (`git pull`) never touches
  it.
- Migrations are exclusively additive (see
  `database/migrations/README.md`).
- The runtime (bot, future core engines) never reads from
  `observations/` or from audit exports -- that's a write-only layer
  from the runtime's perspective.

## Installation

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows (cmd/PowerShell)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

On Windows, if `python`/`pip` aren't the ones you want on `PATH` (or
you have multiple Python versions installed), the
[`py` launcher](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#launcher)
often works better and behaves identically for these commands:

```bat
py -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Neither `python` nor `py` is guaranteed to work, though** — found on
a real Windows install: Windows' own "App Execution Alias" feature can
intercept both names with a near-empty stub that opens a "choose an
app"/Microsoft Store prompt instead of running Python at all, if no
real interpreter has been installed through a path that takes priority
over that stub. If either command does this to you instead of running
Python, see [`windows/README.md`](windows/README.md)'s "Interpreter
detection" section — `windows/run_bot.ps1` finds a real interpreter
itself, robust against exactly this.

For development and running tests:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pytest
```

```bat
:: Windows, via the py launcher (see the note above if this doesn't work)
py -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
py -m pytest
```

**Python version:** developed against 3.13 (the code uses
`enum.StrEnum` and modern typing — it would work on 3.11+, but 3.13
was the original agreed target). **User-verified working on Windows
with Python 3.14.6** (`discord.py==2.7.1`, full test suite —
435 passed — and a real end-to-end Discord DM session, all confirmed
by the person running this project; not independently re-verified in
this sandbox, which only has 3.12.3 available). No code change was
needed for 3.14 support — `enum.StrEnum`/modern typing are unaffected,
and `discord.py`'s own `audioop`-removal workaround (Python 3.13+
removed the `audioop` stdlib module entirely, PEP 594) is handled
internally by `discord.py>=2.7.1` itself via a conditional dependency
on `audioop-lts` — nothing this project's own `requirements.txt` needs
to add explicitly. If you hit an `audioop`-related `ModuleNotFoundError`
regardless, `pip install audioop-lts` resolves it (its `cp313-abi3`
wheel works on 3.13 and 3.14 both, via Python's stable ABI).

**No CI currently exists in this repository** (no `.github/workflows/`
or equivalent) — noted here rather than silently added, since setting
one up is a real, separate decision, not a side effect of a Python
version bump. If/when one is added, it should exercise both the
declared floor (3.11, where `enum.StrEnum` first exists) and the
current target (3.14) — not only whichever version a contributor
happens to have installed locally — so a change that accidentally
breaks compatibility with the floor is caught before it ships.

## Configuration

```bash
copy .env.example .env
```

Fill in at least `DISCORD_TOKEN` in `.env` (Discord Developer Portal ->
your application -> Bot -> Token). The bot needs to be invited to a
server with permission to read and send messages, and **Message
Content Intent** needs to be enabled in the Developer Portal (without
it the bot won't see message content -- `discord_bot.py` relies on it).

## Running

```bash
python -m bot.discord_bot
```

```bat
:: Windows, via the py launcher (see the "Neither python nor py is
:: guaranteed to work" note above -- if this doesn't run the bot,
:: use windows\run_bot.ps1 instead, which finds a real interpreter
:: itself)
py -m bot.discord_bot
```

```bat
:: Windows, robust alternative -- recommended if the above doesn't work
.\windows\run_bot.ps1
```

On first run, `data/coach_keyholder.db` is created automatically,
migrations are applied, and `on_system_startup()` runs (Trust Manager/
Penalty Engine/Recovery Plan/Goal Management recovery, then the outbox
publisher) before the bot connects to Discord.

Send the bot a direct message. **A brand-new user is walked through
onboarding first** (language → AI voice → personality — see
[`docs/architecture/user_onboarding_technical_design.md`](docs/architecture/user_onboarding_technical_design.md)),
resuming automatically from wherever they left off if the bot restarts
mid-onboarding. Once that's done, the supported commands are:
`help` (lists commands), `status` (reports the current Penalty
Window, if any — a real read against real domain state), and
`preferences` (shows your saved onboarding choices) — plus Advanced
Mode's own `mode`/`mode status`/`mode request advanced`/
`mode request standard`/`mode cancel`/`mode confirm` (see
`advanced_mode/README.md` for the underlying mechanism; this project's
*first* write-capable Discord commands — everything before this only
read). Anything else gets a polite "I don't recognize that yet." Only
DMs are processed; messages in a server channel are ignored. See
[`application/README.md`](application/README.md) for the full
boundary between the Discord adapter and the channel-agnostic
application layer underneath it, and what's deliberately not built
yet (no Coach/Keyholder reasoning, no LLM, no write-capable command
outside Advanced Mode's own transition).

**Manually testing the mode transition** (`py -m bot.discord_bot`,
then DM the bot):
1. `mode` — confirms you start in Standard, no pending request.
2. `mode request advanced` — creates the request; explains the
   24-hour wait and second confirmation.
3. `mode status` — shows the pending request's exact state.
4. `mode cancel` — cancels it; mode remains unchanged.

The full transition (24-hour wait → `AWAITING_CONFIRMATION` →
`mode confirm`) is verified by automated tests using a `FrozenClock` —
the production Discord flow has no time shortcut, so manually testing
the complete end-to-end transition means actually waiting 24 real
hours between `mode request advanced` and `mode confirm`.
**Want the bot to start automatically on Windows** instead of running
it manually every time? See [`windows/README.md`](windows/README.md)
for Task Scheduler setup (optional, not required for development).

## Development history

Each phase below is summarized briefly; the module-level READMEs
linked above are the authoritative, detailed record of what each one
covers, what's deferred, and any real findings.

- **Phase 0** -- foundational schema, config, backups, a Discord bot
  skeleton with no AI logic yet.
- **Phase 1.1** -- `infrastructure/clock.py` (`Clock`/`SystemClock`/`FrozenClock`)
  and the repository-wide guard against direct `datetime.now()` calls.
- **Phase 1.2** -- the shared `Database`/`Transaction`/`apply_transition()`
  transactional core, with `database/database.py` rebuilt on top of it.
- **Phase 1.3** -- the architecture baseline (`philosophy.md` v1.12.1
  and the nine architecture documents) moved physically into the
  repository under `docs/architecture/`, plus a consolidated
  `domain_events_catalog.md` with five real cross-document
  inconsistencies found and documented (not yet resolved at the time).
- **Phase 1.4** -- the transactional outbox
  (`infrastructure/outbox.py`, `domain_events` schema): write, claim,
  publish, and consumer-side dedup, all built on `apply_transition()`.
- **Phase 2.1-2.2** -- Trust Manager: Incident registration and
  confirmation, deterministic severity assessment, and the trust score
  recalculation pipeline (evidence -> score, with a bounded
  per-recalculation delta and diminishing-returns confidence).
- **Phase 2.3** -- Penalty Engine: the PenaltyWindow state machine
  (start/freeze/resume/complete), freeze modeled as a set of
  concurrently active reasons rather than a single flag.
- **Phase 2.4** -- the Consumer Framework and Startup Orchestrator
  (`infrastructure/consumer_registry.py`, `system/startup.py`), and the
  first real, working cross-module event subscription (Trust Manager ->
  Penalty Engine). This is where a genuine architectural constraint
  (`NestedTransactionError`, arising when two modules share one
  database core's single-open-transaction guard) was discovered and
  resolved by making event payloads carry everything a consumer needs,
  rather than letting a handler call back into another module's public
  API mid-transaction. See `system/README.md` for the full account --
  this became a standing rule applied to every event added since.
- **Phase 2.5** -- Extension (`should_extend()`), unifying
  window-starting and window-extending into one consumption path, with
  every TBD parameter from the architecture document flagged explicitly
  as this implementation's own default rather than an architectural
  decision.
- **Phase 2.6** -- Recovery Plan, reacting purely to Penalty Engine's
  own events. Wiring it as a second downstream consumer surfaced a
  second real finding: `process_pending_events()` originally processed
  only one batch per call, so an event cascade (one handler's side
  effect triggering another) wouldn't fully propagate within a single
  `on_system_startup()` call. Fixed by draining the cascade in a loop,
  bounded by `max_cascade_rounds` as a safety limit.
- **Phase 2.7** -- Recovery Credit integration: Penalty Engine consumes
  `recovery_plan.task_completed` and decides, independently, how many
  hours a completed task actually earns against the window's capacity.
  This closes the full Incident -> Assessment -> Penalty -> Recovery ->
  Credit -> Penalty Adjustment lifecycle described in
  `penalty_window_technical_design.md` Section 3.4.
- **Phase 2.8** -- a focused architectural review after the milestone
  above (deliberately scoped to logical contradictions, invalid-state
  risks, module coupling, and expensive-to-reverse decisions -- not a
  full style/naming pass) found and fixed three real bugs: task
  transitions with no status guard (`recovery_plan/README.md`), `resume()`
  closing only the most recently opened freeze period instead of every
  matching one, and an idempotency asymmetry in Recovery Credit's
  direct-call path (both `penalty_engine/README.md`). A fourth finding
  -- composition-layer coupling via underscore-prefixed method calls in
  `system/startup.py` -- was deliberately left as documented, not
  restructured (`system/README.md`), consistent with this project's
  standing rule against designing an abstraction before the pattern
  has repeated enough times to reveal its actual shape.
- **Phase 2.9** -- Goal Management: the fourth domain module, and the
  first independent of the Trust Manager -> Penalty Engine -> Recovery
  Plan -> Recovery Credit branch (it reads nothing from the Trust
  Manager for any decision of its own). Covers the Goal lifecycle
  (create/pause/resume/complete/archive), append-only GoalEvidence and
  GoalEvaluation, and the GoalChangeProposal confirmation mechanism that
  gates adaptation/replacement/abandonment behind an explicit,
  content-bound user decision. Two real gaps were found in the
  architecture document while implementing it -- `GoalInterventionType`
  has no value for proposing goal completion, despite the document's
  own prose requiring one, and the lifecycle diagram leaves adaptation
  from a PAUSED goal ambiguous -- both resolved with the
  least-presumptuous reading available and flagged, not silently
  decided (`goal_management/README.md`). GoalAccountabilityAssessment,
  GoalNegotiation, and the actual Trust Manager integration are
  deferred -- they depend on Coach/Keyholder reasoning this system does
  not have built yet.
- **Phase 3.1** -- the first usable vertical slice: a real, minimal path
  from a Discord direct message all the way to a domain module's data
  and back. Introduced `application/`, a channel-agnostic layer
  (`IncomingMessage`/`OutgoingMessage`, `UserService`, `CommandRouter`,
  `ApplicationService`) that `bot/discord_bot.py` -- rewritten as a thin
  adapter -- is the only thing that knows about Discord specifically.
  Two explicit, read-only commands (`help`, `status`); `status` reads
  `PenaltyEngine.get_active_or_frozen_penalty_window()` directly,
  proving the whole pipe against real data. Two real gaps were found
  and fixed along the way: `on_system_startup()` had never actually
  been wired into any running process before this phase, despite
  `system_state_machine.md` requiring it since Section 7 was written;
  and the adapter's first draft coupled audit logging with reply
  generation, so a logging failure silently replaced a real reply with
  the generic error message. See `application/README.md` for the full
  adapter/application-layer boundary, the supported message flow, and
  what's deliberately not built yet (Coach/Keyholder reasoning, an LLM,
  any write-capable command outside Advanced Mode's own transition,
  multi-user support in the domain modules).
