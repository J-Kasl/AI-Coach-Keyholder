scripts/dev_chaster_schema_probe.py

DEVELOPMENT-ONLY, MANUAL, LOCAL DIAGNOSTIC. Never imported by any
production code path (`bot/discord_bot.py`, `application/`,
`chaster/emergency_unlock*.py`, `chaster/callback_service.py`), never
run automatically, and never exposed through Discord, the emergency
listener, or Cloudflare.

Purpose: make read-only Chaster API calls -- GET /auth/profile and
GET /locks?status=active -- using a Chaster developer token you
provide interactively, so the real response shapes can be inspected
to resolve this project's two remaining schema blockers
(`chaster/callback_service.py::unconfirmed_identity_resolver`,
`chaster/emergency_unlock_provider.py::unconfirmed_lock_field_extractor`).
This script does NOT modify either of those -- it only prints what
the real API actually returns, for a human to read and decide from.

Primary path reuses the existing, already-tested production helpers
exactly as instructed -- no parallel HTTP client for the happy path:
- chaster.oauth_client.ChasterOAuthClient.fetch_raw_profile()
- chaster.lock_client.ChasterLockClient.list_active_locks()

DIAGNOSTIC FALLBACK: both production helpers deliberately discard the
response body on a non-200 status (they only report the status code,
by design), which makes root-causing a real API error impossible
from their exception message alone. When a primary call fails, this
script makes its OWN, additional, still strictly read-only GET
request to the SAME confirmed endpoint/method to capture and print
the full (redacted) response for diagnosis -- never a write endpoint.

CURL-EQUIVALENT DIAGNOSTIC (added this turn): a real Windows
`curl.exe -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" "https://api.chaster.app/locks?status=active"`
succeeded (HTTP 200) where our Python `requests`-based call returned
HTTP 400. Reconstructing the exact `requests.PreparedRequest` this
project's own production client sends (via `requests.Session.
prepare_request()`, without making a real call) shows Python's
`requests` library adds several headers by default that curl's own
minimal request does not send: `User-Agent: python-requests/<version>`
(vs. curl's own `User-Agent: curl/<version>`), `Accept-Encoding: gzip,
deflate`, and `Connection: keep-alive`. This is a CONFIRMED, real
difference (verified by direct inspection of the actual prepared
headers, not guessed) -- but NOT yet a confirmed root cause. This
script's `_print_diagnostic_response()` gained a `curl_equivalent`
mode that reproduces curl's exact minimal header set (`requests`
lets a header be fully removed by passing `None` as its value) for
`/locks?status=active` specifically, alongside the current default
variant, so the next real run settles this empirically. `/auth/profile`
is intentionally left untouched by this specific diagnostic pass, per
instruction: `/locks` is the current priority.

SECURITY, BY DESIGN:
- The token is read via `getpass.getpass()` -- input is not echoed to
  the terminal, and interactive `getpass` input is never touched by
  shell command history (unlike a command-line argument or an
  environment variable set inline on the same command line).
- The token is never written to a file, never logged, never included
  in any printed output, and never referenced in any exception or
  diagnostic message -- the diagnostic fallback below never prints
  the Authorization header's own value, only response-side data.
- Only GET requests are ever made -- this script contains no
  POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE call of any kind, in particular never
  `/locks/{lockId}/unlock` or `/locks/{lockId}/emergency-unlock`.
- Response headers and bodies are redacted before printing: any JSON
  key whose name contains a sensitive-looking substring (token,
  secret, password, auth, email, key, credential -- case-insensitive,
  at any nesting depth) has its value replaced with `<redacted>`.
  This is a generic filter over whatever the API actually returns --
  it does not assume or guess Chaster's schema. A response body that
  is not valid JSON is never printed raw (it could, in principle,
  echo back something unexpected) -- only its length is reported.

USAGE (from the repository root, with your virtualenv active):

    python3 scripts/dev_chaster_schema_probe.py

You will be prompted for your developer token; nothing else is
required. The token exists only in local memory for the duration of
this one process and is discarded when it exits.

      empirically and found NOT to change the outcome (kept here only
      so a rerun can reconfirm this next to the new curl-equivalent
      variant, not because it's still considered a live hypothesis).
    - "curl_equivalent": reproduces curl's own minimal header set
      exactly (User-Agent: curl/8.14.1, Accept: */*, Authorization
      only) -- `requests` removes a default header entirely when its
      value is explicitly set to None.

      a Chaster developer's own suggestion in their #developers
      channel: `Accept: */*` -> `Accept: application/json`. Derived
      from the curl_equivalent header set itself (never duplicated)
      so the two variants can never silently drift apart.
    - "client_id": IDENTICAL to "curl_equivalent" except it ALSO adds
      `X-Chaster-Client-Id: <client_id>` -- per a Chaster developer's
      own confirmed working Go example (their #developers channel),
      which sends exactly `X-Chaster-Client-Id` alongside
      `Authorization: Bearer <token>` for developer-token requests.
      Isolates exactly one variable versus "curl_equivalent": the
      presence of this one header. Requires `client_id` to be passed;
      raises if it is missing, since a silent no-op variant here would
      be misleading, not a genuine test of the hypothesis.
