system/startup.py

The System Composition Layer's startup orchestrator
(system_state_machine.md Section 7; System State Machine Finding 4:
"startup orchestration was never really [any single module's]
responsibility to begin with"). Owns only sequencing and lifecycle
coordination -- no domain state, no business decisions
(philosophy.md 2.11 applied to orchestration itself, per
system_state_machine.md's own note).

Three domain modules exist today (Trust Manager, Penalty Engine,
Recovery Plan) -- this orchestrator calls only their recovery steps, in
the order system_state_machine.md Section 7 establishes, and skips
steps 3-5 of that section's full sequence (Activity Authorization,
Hygiene Privilege, Goal Management) with no placeholder calls -- those
modules do not exist yet, and adding a commented-out or no-op call for
each would be exactly the kind of speculative scaffolding this
project's own discipline avoids.
