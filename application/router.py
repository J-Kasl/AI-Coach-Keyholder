"""
application/router.py

A minimal, explicit command router. Knows nothing about Discord (or
any channel) and nothing about how any handler is implemented
internally -- it only matches trimmed, lowercased message text against
a fixed, explicitly registered set of commands and calls the matching
handler.

Deliberately NOT a natural-language intent parser -- that is real
scope, later. This slice matches exact command strings, nothing more,
consistent with the request for "explicit and limited" supported
actions.
