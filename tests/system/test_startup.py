"""
tests/system/test_startup.py

The key integration test: confirms an Incident via Trust Manager, then
runs on_system_startup() (NOT a direct call to
PenaltyEngine.start_window_if_eligible()) and verifies a PenaltyWindow
was created purely through the real event-driven wiring
(system/startup.py's build_consumer_registry()) — proving the
NestedTransactionError concern that shaped
_consume_confirmed_incident_in_transaction()'s design is
actually resolved, not just reasoned about.
