CE-20. Per explicit review instruction: does NOT run the existing
pytest suite from inside a pytest test (that's the final, separate
regression-suite step of the implementation, not something this file
does). Instead:

1. Statically parses every domain module / application / bot source
   file's own AST and confirms none of them import `conversation_engine`.
2. Constructs a real ApplicationService the ordinary way and directly
   exercises a few existing command paths, proving their behavior is
   unaffected by conversation_engine's mere existence on disk.
