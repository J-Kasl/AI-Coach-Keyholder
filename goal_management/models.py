"""
goal_management/models.py

Data structures for Goal Management Slice 1. Canonical:
docs/architecture/goal_technical_design.md Sections 2, 4, 5.1, 5.3.
See goal_management/README.md for exactly what this slice covers and
what is deferred (GoalAccountabilityAssessment, GoalNegotiation, the
Trust Manager integration).

GOAL-1 is enforced structurally by this file's own imports: nothing
here imports trust_manager or penalty_engine, and nothing in this
package ever will for this module's own decisions (Section 1).
