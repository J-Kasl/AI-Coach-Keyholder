"""
penalty_engine/window.py

Pure, deterministic functions describing a PenaltyWindow's countdown.
Canonical: docs/architecture/penalty_window_technical_design.md
Sections 1 (I5, I6), 2.2. No database access — mirrors
trust_manager/severity.py and trust_manager/recalculation.py's own
separation of pure computation from persistence.

`MAX_TARGET_ACTIVE_HOURS = 336` is given explicitly by the architecture
document (I5: "min(base_duration_hours + extensions_hours, 336)").
`DEFAULT_BASE_DURATION_HOURS`, by contrast, is NOT given a specific
value anywhere in the document — starting a window requires some base
duration, and nothing in Sections 1-4 commits to a number. This is this
slice's own default, flagged here exactly like
trust_manager/recalculation.py flags MAX_ABS_EFFECTIVE_WEIGHT/CONFIDENCE_K,
for the same reason: so a future reviewer knows this one, unlike
MAX_TARGET_ACTIVE_HOURS, was not transcribed from the architecture
document.
