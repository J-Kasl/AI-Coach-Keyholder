Data structures for Penalty Engine Slice 1 — the core state machine
(start, freeze-as-a-set-of-reasons, resume, natural completion) and its
public read APIs. Canonical:
docs/architecture/penalty_window_technical_design.md Sections 2.1-2.6.

Deferred to a later slice (see penalty_engine/README.md): extend()/
should_extend() (Extension integration), recovery_credit_ledger/
recovery_credit_decisions (Recovery Plan integration, 3.4), terminate()
(administrative termination — explicitly deferred by the architecture
document itself, 2.1).
